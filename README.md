Facial recognition is a technology that involves classifying and recognizing human faces, mostly by mapping individual facial features and recording the unique ratio mathematically and storing the data as a face print.
Facial detection is the process of identifying a human face within a scanned image; the process of extraction involves obtaining a facial region such as the eye spacing, variation, angle and ratio to determine if the object is human.
